# DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry

This repo contains informaiton on becoming a CVE Mentor, and a list of current CVE mentors. CVE Mentors duties primarily include:

* Determining if something is a security vulnerability from the CVE perspective (CVE_is_vuln)
* Determining how to SPLIT/MERGE a CVE request(s) (CVE_counting)
* Signing off on a CVE request as being correct (CVE_assign)
* Providing help and training to other CVE mentors and people who want to be CVE mentors (can_train_others)
* Confirming and creating other CVE mentors

Optionally a CVE mentor can also have a block of CVEs that they can directly assign from, making them a CNA effectively. Such CNAs are listed in https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CNA-Registry 

# How to become a CVE Mentor

Becoming a CVE Mentor is simple:

1. Find a mentor to sponsor you (check the existing registry, if you can't find one contact kurt@seifried.org)
2. Fill out the CVE Mentor template (name, email addresses, etc.) available at https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/blob/master/mentors/cve-mentor-json-template-v1.json
3. Email the template and attached copies of your GPG key and the three signed file (listed below) to kurt@seifried.org, please indicate in your email if you want to also become a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), this is not required (e.g. some CVE Mentors will work with existing CNAs, or specialize in training and other related activities). Please use the subject line "DWF CVE Mentor request" to make it easier to spot.

## Signing the agreements 

You must sign the 3 agreement documents in  https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/tree/master/agreements with the gpg key you will be using to sign CVE ID assignments. Simply use gpg:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/CVE-CNA-Rules.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/CVE-Terms-of-Use.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-Mentor-Registry/master/agreements/DWF-Contributor-Agreement.txt

gpg --clearsign CVE-CNA-Rules.txt
gpg --clearsign CVE-Terms-of-Use.txt
gpg --clearsign DWF-Contributor-Agreement.txt
```

And then attach and send the 3 .asc files to the DWF along with your public key and the template file so we can create a mentor record.
